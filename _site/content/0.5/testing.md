# Testing procedures

## What are we testing for?  Decreased organic material. Usual sewage influent measures:


| Test | CBOD5 | TSS |
| :---: | :---: | :---:|
|  | mg/L   |  mg/L |
| Influent sewage  | 350 - 600   |  360-600 |
| Treated Effluent  | 10   |  10 |

- Once we show adequate performance in simple reduction of CBOD--one measurement of the amount of organic material in the influent--we must turn to more comprehensive measures.

Here's an example of test results for a system sold by [MicroSepTec](http://www.microseptec.com/engineers-effluent.htm); or [Busse](https://busse-is.de)

The most recent US standard (not counting newer state standards)
is the [ANSI/NSF 350.1](https://aspe.org/sites/default/files/webfm/pdfs/NSF.pdf)

Read it for the test standards RedHorse must meet.


  Here are some relevant international standards.
[International standards for domestic on site treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16104416)
[A system for on-site evaluation of small wastewater treatment plants (2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14753562)


Note that many studies assess the value of creation of biogas in the anaerobic chamber for fuel. Our focus is clean water, not fuel, but a spectrum of designs should be examined.

- Treatment systems should meet NSF/ANSI 40 standards:


  ```
  To achieve certification, treatment systems must produce an acceptable quality of effluent during a six-month (26-week) test.

  Class I systems must achieve a 30-day average effluent quality of 25 mg/L CBOD5 and 30 mg/L TSS or less, and pH 6.0-9.0 spanning six months of testing. System service and maintenance are prohibited during the test period.

  ```

## Amount of organic material in water
- By weight
  - Total solids
  - Total suspended solids + total sediment

  - BOD, COD, and testing procedures

## Look here for what to do at RedHorse this week  - [Can COD test be done in 2 days, and substitute for BOD?](https://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.html?number=C992&title=Understanding%20Laboratory%20Wastewater%20Tests:%20I.%20ORGANICS%20(BOD,%20COD,%20TOC,%20O&G))
