# Waste Water Treatment Design for non-sewered systems
## Household Treatment Systems: design, construction, operation, and maintenance with real-time controls

#### Updated: Saturday, August 17, 2018

### For RedHorse implementation in August, 2019
- Read [ANSI/NSF 350.1](https://aspe.org/sites/default/files/webfm/pdfs/NSF.pdf), the new US standard for household treatment certification.  It lists the test elements and the CBOD5 and TSS values we must reach to pass the test.  It also says how, in general, to run the tests.
- look at the page [Testing](./testing.html) for more detail .

This working document surveys global research and development of non-sewered sanitation systems, or NSSS, surveyed in 2018 in Beijing at the [Reinvent Toilet Expo 2018](https://www.iso.org/news/ref2346.html).

[National](https://aspe.org/sites/default/files/webfm/pdfs/NSF.pdf) and international [International Organization for Standardization 30500](https://www.iso.org/standard/72523.html) standards now exist for NSSS at a household level.

An example of a high-quality product shipping today is the [Biomicrobics biomembrane system](http://biomicrobics.com/products/biobarrier-membrane-bioreactor-mbr/) that satisfies the US NSF/ANSI Standard 350.

A second system is [Sedron Technologies (Janicki) Firelight Toilet](https://www.sedron.com/firelight-toilet/), which will satisfy Standard 350.1

A third example is the [CalTech Solar Powered Toilet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&hl=en&client=mv-google&v=eVQaMsvBLb8&nomobile=1)

A fourth example is [EAWAG Autarky](https://www.eawag.ch/en/research/humanwelfare/wastewater/projekte/autarky/) developed by ETH Zurich.

Note that these systems use technologies beyond standard biological and settlement systems.

These systems are subcomponents of net-zero self-sustaining systems for life support, once only designed for space stations and planetary exploration.  Advances in these communities are now applied to devices for use in slum and rural communities on Earth.

This site surveys the science, engineering, construction, and operation of household-size water and wastewater subsystems, with specific focus on wastewater recovery and reuse.

As an science-fiction example of a net-zero life support system, see ["_The Martian_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8) showing imagined total material reuse for water and wastes on the surface of Mars. All energy derives directly from the Sun; there is no source of new water. Can such a system work?  For our focus, can wastewater recovery of potable water and nutrients be made to work inexpensively on Earth?

Hundreds of research groups, companies, and governments have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to develop systems capable of treating household wastes for water recovery and energy conversion at the household level (see list below). Military, maritime and aerospace systems are constantly redesigned with promising new technologies.

The RedHorse design for water reuse is based on engineered field experiments conducted by the Human Needs Project in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya and San Rafael, California; RedHorse is currently building a working model, while dozens of existing companies currently are shipping systems of varying capabilities.

Testing of the RedHorse design will follow the same analytical procedures described for the [Caltech Toilet](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/ew/c8ew00209f)

RedHorse, in cooperation with UC Berkeley, is building computational models of systems in design or on the market today, to compare and contrast design models. Then, with field data from operational sites, RedHorse proposes to maintain an on-going comparison of actual field performances world-wide, incorporating realized capital and operating expense data.
