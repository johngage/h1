<h1 id="Chapter-1:-Introduction">Chapter 1: Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Chapter-1:-Introduction"> </a></h1><p>Over two billion people today have inadequate sanitation. Dozens of groups world-wide
are attempting to bring new science and new, low-cost technologies together to create inexpensive, locally-produced devices to build a new system of distributed waste treatment accessible to all.</p>
<p>To change water and waste-water systems from today's model of large, piped, centrally-processed systems to a new distributed system
requires four mutually supportive components:</p>
<ul>
<li>a clear understanding of the science and engineering of water and waste</li>
<li>a design and implementation
plan based on specific characteristics of each site</li>
<li>an economic and business
plan capable of sustainable, profitable operation</li>
<li>a management and political environment
dedicated to the highest standards of quality and community responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many initiatives today address the lack of sanitation in India, in China, and in urban slums
world-wide.  These new systems should find application in every home, at every level of economic wealth.</p>
<p>The RedHorse Constructors initiative to build a compact, energy-efficient home treatment system draws on lessons from operating the <strong>Kibera Town Centre</strong>in Nairobi, Kenya, for almost ten years.</p>
<p>This sequence of chapters seeks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>introduce the parameters of the global problem,</li>
<li>present the array of solutions presented as of July, 2019</li>
<li>present the technical underpinnings of new tools in data science to allow analysis and design</li>
<li>present tools for global exchange of operational and cost data, to allow open sharing of best practices</li>
</ul>
