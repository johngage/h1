<p>The Gates Foundation Toilet initiative has supported hundreds of researchers and research
institutions to develop technologies appropriate for urban slums and rural farms.
<a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2018/11/Bill-Gates-Launches-Reinvented-Toilet-Expo-Showcasing-New-Pathogen-Killing-Sanitation-Products">Gates Foundation Toilet Expo 2018</a></p>
<p>Each academic project has been strongly encouraged to create a commercial component, to move toward global volume.</p>
<p>Today's commercial products include:</p>
<ul>
<li>China (Clear, CRRC, EcoSan)</li>
<li>United States (Sedron Technologies)</li>
<li>India (Eram Scientific, Ankur Scientific, Tide Technocrats)</li>
<li>Thailand (SCG Chemicals)</li>
<li>Japan (LIXIL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Twenty reinvented toilet and omni-processor technologies and products rooted in the foundationâ€™s portfolio of investments are now available for commercial licencing and production.</p>
<p>New international standards: <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72523.html">International Organization for Standardization 30500</a>, define the operational requirements for the reinvented toilet, as well as other existing and future stand-alone, non-sewered sanitation technologies.</p>
