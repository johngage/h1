RedHorse Research Platform
=================

RedHorse Constructors is building a series of models of sewerless sanitation systems.

The challenge is to provide, in a small volume, an energy-efficient coupling of technologies to remove pathogens, remove ionic contaminants, and provide high-quality water that could enable potable reuse.

Alternative configurations may provide treated water at a quality sufficient for irrigation.

Sludge material may be utilized for energy, or for agricultural fertilizer.  Urine-derivatives may be used for fertilizer.

Our goal is to provide a global test-bed for distributed water treatment systems.
