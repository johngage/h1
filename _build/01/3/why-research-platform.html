<h1 id="RedHorse-Research-Platform">RedHorse Research Platform<a class="anchor-link" href="#RedHorse-Research-Platform"> </a></h1><p>RedHorse Constructors is building a series of models of sewerless sanitation systems.</p>
<p>The challenge is to provide, in a small volume, an energy-efficient coupling of technologies to remove pathogens, remove ionic contaminants, and provide high-quality water that could enable potable reuse.</p>
<p>Alternative configurations may provide treated water at a quality sufficient for irrigation.</p>
<p>Sludge material may be utilized for energy, or for agricultural fertilizer.  Urine-derivatives may be used for fertilizer.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a global test-bed for distributed water treatment systems.</p>
