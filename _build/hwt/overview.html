<h1 id="Overview">Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview"> </a></h1><p>Over two billion people today have inadequate sanitation. Dozens of groups world-wide
are attempting to bring new science and new, low-cost technologies together to create inexpensive, locally-produced devices to build a new system of distributed waste treatment accessible to all. <strong>Home Water Treatment</strong>, or <strong>Distributed Water Treatment</strong>, or <strong>Non-sewer Systems</strong>.</p>
<p>To <strong>change water and waste-water systems from today's model of large, piped, centrally-processed systems</strong> to a new <strong>distributed system</strong>
requires four mutually supportive components:</p>
<ul>
<li>a clear <strong>understanding</strong> of the science and engineering of water and waste</li>
<li>a <strong>design and implementation
plan</strong> based on specific characteristics of each site</li>
<li>an <strong>economic and business
plan</strong> capable of sustainable, profitable operation</li>
<li>a commitment by management and political leaders to high standards of quality, response to the community, and open data and open analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many initiatives today address the lack of sanitation in India, in China, and in urban slums
world-wide.  However, <strong>these new systems should be in every home</strong>, in every school, in every clinic, at every level of economic wealth. We are in a new environment of fire, drought, and flood; even those in the richest countries can no longer rely upon a steady supply of clean water.</p>
<p>This sequence of chapters seeks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>introduce the parameters of the global problem,</li>
<li>present the array of solutions presented as of July, 2019</li>
<li>present the technical underpinnings of new tools in data science to allow analysis and design</li>
<li>present tools for global exchange of operational and cost data, to allow open sharing of best practices</li>
</ul>
