  abstract = {As this book helps highlight, slum health is not a static state measured through discrete diseases, but rather is an ongoing process of understanding and improving the determinants of well-being among the urban poor. Much is still unknown about the biology, exposure pathways, and efficacy of particular interventions\textemdash{}whether they be microbiologic, clinical, environmental, social, or some combination of all of these. What we recognize, however, is that scientific uncertainty is no reason not to act for slum health today. The issues and challenges are too great to delay. In addition, the science of slum health is only improved through},

  abstract = {This paper explores the question of what systems thinking adds to the field of global health. Observing that elements of systems thinking are already common in public health research, the article discusses which of the large body of theories, methods, and tools associated with systems thinking are more useful. The paper reviews the origins of systems thinking, describing a range of the theories, methods, and tools. A common thread is the idea that the behavior of systems is governed by common principles that can be discovered and expressed. They each address problems of complexity, which is a frequent challenge in global health. The different methods and tools are suited to different types of inquiry and involve both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The paper concludes by emphasizing that explicit models used in systems thinking provide new opportunities to understand and continuously test and revise our understanding of the nature of things, including how to intervene to improve people's health. \textcopyright{} 2014 Peters.},

This article talks about a study carried out in Kibera, the second largest slum in Africa located in Nairobi, Kenya, which examines how slums are morphologically constituted with respect to their socio-economic settings. The study stems from the author's several years of work as a community design architect on slum upgrading projects, many of which were of a participatory nature. Given that slums exist outside of formal planning and lack documented development records, a basic approach to studying slums was adopted. This article uses analogies to expound on the link between the spatial-temporal formation of the slum and the socio-economic activities and practices of its residents. It goes on to show the crucial need for slum upgrading programmes to pay attention to this strong yet hidden interrelationship in order to meet the needs of the beneficiaries in a sustainable manner.},

  abstract = {Improved sanitation has been associated with a reduced prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and has been hypothesized to prevent fecal contamination from spreading throughout the household environment. We evaluated the effect of providing households with a pit latrine with a plastic slab and drophole cover, child feces management tools, and associated behavioral messaging on reducing STH eggs in household soil. We collected soil samples from 2107 households (898 control and 1209 improved sanitation intervention households) that were enrolled in the WASH Benefits cluster randomized controlled trial in rural Kenya and performed a post-intervention analysis after two years of intervention exposure. Following a pre-specified analysis plan, we combined all households that received the sanitation intervention into one group for comparison to control households. The prevalence of STH eggs in soil was 18.9\% in control households and 17.0\% in intervention households. The unadjusted prevalence ratio of total STH eggs in the intervention groups compared to the control group was 0.94 (95\% CI: 0.78\textendash{}1.13). The geometric mean concentration was 0.05 eggs/g dry soil in control households and intervention households. Unadjusted and adjusted models gave similar results. We found use of a shared latrine, presence of a roof over the sampling area, and the number of dogs owned at baseline was associated with an increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil; the presence of a latrine that was at least 2 years old and a latrine with a covered drophole was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Soil moisture content was also associated with an increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Our results indicate that an intervention designed to increase access to improved latrines and child feces management tools may not be enough to impact environmental occurrence of STH in endemic areas where latrine coverage is already high.},

  issn = {0013-936X},
  shorttitle = {Beyond {{User Acceptance}}},
  abstract = {Water resource managers often tout the potential of potable water reuse to provide a reliable, local source of drinking water in water-scarce regions. Despite data documenting the ability of advanced treatment technologies to treat municipal wastewater effluent to meet existing drinking water quality standards, many utilities face skepticism from the public about potable water reuse. Prior research on this topic has mainly focused on marketing strategies for garnering public acceptance of the process. This study takes a broader perspective on the adoption of potable water reuse based on concepts of societal legitimacy, which is the generalized perception or assumption that a technology is desirable or appropriate within its social context. To assess why some potable reuse projects were successfully implemented while others faced fierce public opposition, we performed a series of 20 expert interviews and reviewed in-depth case studies from potable reuse projects in California. Results show that proponents of a legitimated potable water reuse project in Orange County, California engaged in a portfolio of strategies that addressed three main dimensions of legitimacy. In contrast, other proposed projects that faced extensive public opposition relied on a smaller set of legitimation strategies that focused near-exclusively on the development of robust water treatment technology. Widespread legitimation of potable water reuse projects, including direct potable water reuse, may require the establishment of a portfolio of standards, procedures, and possibly new institutions.},

  volume = {53},
  issn = {0013-936X},
  abstract = {Active samplers for ambient monitoring of trace contaminants in surface water are highly desirable, but their use is often constrained by power supply. Here, we proposed a novel solution by coupling an improved osmotic pump (OP) with a solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge to construct a power-free active sampler for organic contaminants. The OP simply consisted of two cylindrical chambers separated by a reverse osmosis membrane. We, for the first time, added ion-exchange resins into the OP inlet chamber and successfully constructed OPs with a smooth and constant flow. In the OP-SPE sampler, water was continuously drawn through the SPE cartridge at a constant flow, and time-weighted average concentration over the sampling course may be easily calculated from the amount of target analytes retained on the SPE cartridge and water collected in the sampler. The OP-SPE samplers were deployed in a river to detect herbicides, and the measured concentrations were largely in agreement with the average of 11 daily spot samples. Given that a wide range of SPE cartridges are available for different classes of organic contaminants, this approach is versatile and may find widespread applications for in situ sampling of surface water under different conditions, including poorly accessible locations.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in swine feed can select for antibiotic resistance in swine enteric bacteria. Leaking swine waste storage pits and the land-application of swine manure can result in the dispersion of resistant bacteria to water sources. However, there are few data comparing levels of resistant bacteria in swine manure\textendash{}impacted water sources versus unaffected sources.ObjectivesThe goal of this study was to analyze surface water and groundwater situated up and down gradient from a swine facility for antibiotic-resistant enterococci and other fecal indicators.MethodsSurface water and groundwater samples (n = 28) were collected up and down gradient from a swine facility from 2002 to 2004. Fecal indicators were isolated by membrane filtration, and enterococci (n = 200) were tested for susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, virginiamycin, and vancomycin.ResultsMedian concentrations of enterococci, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli were 4- to 33-fold higher in down-gradient versus up-gradient surface water and groundwater. We observed higher minimal inhibitory concentrations for four antibiotics in enterococci isolated from down-gradient versus up-gradient surface water and groundwater. Elevated percentages of erythromycin- (p = 0.02) and tetracycline-resistant (p = 0.06) enterococci were detected in down-gradient surface waters, and higher percentages of tetracycline- (p = 0.07) and clindamycin-resistant (p {$<$} 0.001) enterococci were detected in down-gradient groundwater.ConclusionsWe detected elevated levels of fecal indicators and antibiotic-resistant enterococci in water sources situated down gradient from a swine facility compared with up-gradient sources. These findings provide additional evidence that water contaminated with swine manure could contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract = {Although many U.S. homes rely on private wells, few studies have investigated the quality of these water sources. This cross-sectional study evaluated private well water quality in Maryland, and explored possible environmental sources that could impact water quality. Well water samples (n = 118) were collected in four Maryland counties and were analyzed for microbiological and chemical contaminants. Data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture were used to evaluate associations between the presence of animal feeding operations and well water quality at the zip code level using logistic regression. Overall, 43.2\% of tested wells did not meet at least one federal health-based drinking water standard. Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, enterococci, and Escherichia coli were detected in 25.4\%, 15.3\%, 5.1\%, and 3.4\% of tested wells, respectively. Approximately 26\%, 3.4\%, and {$<$}1\% of wells did not meet standards for pH, nitrate-N, and total dissolved solids, respectively. There were no statistically significant associations between the presence of cattle, dairy, broiler, turkey, or aquaculture operations and the detection of fecal indicator bacteria in tested wells. In conclusion, nearly half of tested wells did not meet federal health-based drinking water standards, and additional research is needed to evaluate factors that impact well water quality. However, homeowner education on well water testing and well maintenance could be important for public health.},
