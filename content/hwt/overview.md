Overview
=======================

Over two billion people today have inadequate sanitation. Dozens of groups world-wide
are attempting to bring new science and new, low-cost technologies together to create inexpensive, locally-produced devices to build a new system of distributed waste treatment accessible to all. **Home Water Treatment**, or **Distributed Water Treatment**, or **Non-sewer Systems**.

To **change water and waste-water systems from today's model of large, piped, centrally-processed systems** to a new **distributed system**
requires four mutually supportive components:
- a clear **understanding** of the science and engineering of water and waste
- a **design and implementation
plan** based on specific characteristics of each site
- an **economic and business
plan** capable of sustainable, profitable operation
- a commitment by management and political leaders to high standards of quality, response to the community, and open data and open analysis.

Many initiatives today address the lack of sanitation in India, in China, and in urban slums
world-wide.  However, **these new systems should be in every home**, in every school, in every clinic, at every level of economic wealth; we are in a new

This sequence of chapters seeks to:
- introduce the parameters of the global problem,
- present the array of solutions presented as of July, 2019
- present the technical underpinnings of new tools in data science to allow analysis and design
- present tools for global exchange of operational and cost data, to allow open sharing of best practices
