#RedHorse
### RedHorse implementation in August, 2019
- Assignments for working team:
1.  Read [ANSI/NSF 350.1](https://aspe.org/sites/default/files/webfm/pdfs/NSF.pdf), the new US standard for household treatment certification.  It lists the test elements and the CBOD5 and TSS values we must reach to pass the test.  It also says how, in general, to run the tests.
2. Look at the page [Testing](./testing.html) for more detail.
3. Review all the competing products listed on the Manufacturers page, and their testing regimes.
